# fuel_consumption_tracker

Simple app to track average fuel consumption. Free, minimal, and open source. No bullshit features.

## Ideas

- ability to edit logs
- ability to change liters/gallons
- ability to change miles/kimeters
- autohide keyboard on main screen
- datetime field to add_log page
- cancel button to new_log
- auto odometer to fuel_fueld
- titlebar bottom shadow
- history listview starts from bottom
- https://pub.dev/packages/rate_my_app
- message on main page if not enough logs
- tries to calculate consumption before you have 2 logs?
- if min and max odo are the same, answer is InfinityL
- finnish translation

### TEST

- test what whappens if you don't log in order
- date format picker on smaller screens


### HIFI

- indigo to indigogradient?
- history screen transition
