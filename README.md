# fuel_consumption_tracker

Simple app to track average fuel consumption. Free, minimal, and open source. No bullshit features. [Available on gPlay[(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=labs.ankia.fuel_consumption_tracker).

| Main screen                       | New log/edit log                 | View logs                             | Settings                                  |

## Ideas (a.k.a. todo)

- finnish translation
- prettify code
- export excel
    - save to gDrive
- history view should be chronological order (currently sorts by added)
- break history_list_view.dart to multiple files
- use Get theme changes instead of ThemeConsumer


### TEST

- test what whappens if you don't log in order
- date format picker on smaller screens
- test on smaller screens
- test on tablets!


### BUGS

- unit_tile doesn't rebuild when resetting everything
- consumption is sometimes negative when only one log, maybe prefs get messed up when editing logs?
- Minus consumption when you have 2 logs and delete logs (doesnt recalulcate if you later add new logs)


### HIFI

- indigo to indigogradient?
- history screen transition
- titlebar bottom shadow
- change submit button text when editing log
- calendar view when tank'd



## stuff

- prefs hive box
    - 'minOdo', 'maxOdo' are smallest and biggest odos recorded
    - 'imperialEnabled' is in prefs instead of settings, because it's more relevant there


### things I've learned

- Using valuableListenableBuilder for everything is a mess (if the app grows), easier to just implement proper state management
- Hive is way easier and better than shared_preferences
- Always make helper class for shared_prefs etc. which automatically returns default values
- abstract class = can't make instance of that class
    - static method = called directly from class, not instance
- making quick n' dirty (frontend) prototype of the app really helps get the ball rolling
- popup menu (especially showMenu method) sucks and shouldn't be used
