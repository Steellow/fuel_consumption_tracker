# fuel_consumption_tracker

Simple app to track average fuel consumption. Free, minimal, and open source. No bullshit features.

## Ideas

- ability to edit logs
- ability to change liters/gallons
- ability to change miles/kimeters
- autohide keyboard on main screen
- datetime field to add_log page
- auto odometer to fuel_fueld
- titlebar bottom shadow
- https://pub.dev/packages/rate_my_app
- finnish translation
- test if mpg actually works
- total fuel tile update units
- listview update units

### TEST

- test what whappens if you don't log in order
- date format picker on smaller screens


### HIFI

- indigo to indigogradient?
- history screen transition


## stuff

prefs hive box

    'minOdo', 'maxOdo' are smallest and biggest odos recorded


## things I've learned

- Using valuableListenableBuilder for everything is a mess (if the app grows), easier to just implement proper state management
- Hive is way easier and better than shared_preferences
- Always make helper class for shared_prefs etc. which automatically returns default values
- abstract class = can't make instance of that class
    - static method = called directly from class, not instace
